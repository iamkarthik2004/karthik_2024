# Project Title: Portfolio Website

# Project Overview: 
The Portfolio Website was developed as part of the Coding Cohort, a 6-week peer-oriented project bootcamp organized by IEEE SB SBCE and IEEE SB SNGCE. The bootcamp provided an excellent platform for enhancing coding skills and building projects in a collaborative environment.

# Coding Cohort Details:
Duration: 6 weeks (Starting from September 1)
Organized By: IEEE SB SBCE and IEEE SB SNGCE
Focus: Building real-world projects and honing development skills
Weekly Assignments: The bootcamp provided assignments every week, helping participants progress step-by-step:
Week 1: [Assignment Link]
Week 2: [Assignment Link]
Week 3: [Assignment Link]
Week 4: [Assignment Link]
Week 5: [Assignment Link]
Through this cohort, I gained hands-on experience with web development, specifically in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while receiving feedback and collaborating with peers. It offered invaluable exposure to project development from scratch, enhancing both my coding skills and teamwork abilities.

# Key Technologies & Features:
HTML (HyperText Markup Language):

Purpose: 
Defines the website's basic structure and content.
Role in the Project: Acts as the foundation, organizing various elements like headings, sections, paragraphs, images, and links.
Accessibility: Proper HTML structuring enhances usability for all visitors, including those with disabilities, ensuring that the site is accessible and navigable.
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):

Purpose: 
Controls the visual presentation, including colors, fonts, spacing, and overall layout.
Custom Styling: Allows customization to create an aesthetically pleasing design, aligning with your personal or professional brand.
Responsive Design: Ensures the website adapts smoothly to different devices, such as desktops, tablets, and smartphones, for a consistent user experience.
Animations & Transitions: Adds interactivity and polish, enhancing the site's engagement and appeal.
JavaScript:

Purpose: 
Adds interactivity and dynamic features to the website.
User Engagement: Enables elements like content that changes based on user actions, form validations, and real-time data handling.
Advanced Animations: Beyond CSS, JavaScript creates complex animations, interactive sliders, and smooth scrolling effects.
API Integration: Can be used to embed social media feeds, load live project data from platforms like GitHub, or include analytics for tracking visitor engagement.
# Functional Highlights:
Contact Form with Validation: A simple, interactive form where users can reach out. JavaScript handles real-time validation to ensure data accuracy before submission.
Responsive Layout: Adapts the content and layout to various screen sizes, ensuring an optimal viewing experience across all devices.
Interactive Elements: Features like content that expands on click, image sliders, or dynamic project showcases to engage visitors.
Polished Design: Uses CSS animations and JavaScript effects for a smooth, professional appearance.

# Conclusion:
This Portfolio Website project leverages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a well-structured, visually compelling, and interactive online presence. It serves as a digital resume and project showcase, emphasizing your technical skills and creativity.
